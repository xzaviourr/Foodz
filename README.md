# Foodz
Foodz is a online food ordering site, that allows its users to order food from home. 
It can be loggind using 2 ways, one user login and one restaurant login. It is still under progress.

To run the website , download any php server, I used xampp;
Create a database named foodsys and import the database file into it.
Run the localhost server and open home.php file.

Hope you liked my project.
